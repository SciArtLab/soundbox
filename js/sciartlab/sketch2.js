/**
 *  Pitch Detection using Auto Correlation.
 *
 *  Auto correlation multiplies each sample in a buffer by all
 *  of the other samples. This emphasizes the fundamental
 *  frequency.
 *
 *  Running the signal through a low pass filter prior to
 *  autocorrelation helps bring out the fundamental frequency.
 *
 *  The visualization is a correlogram, which plots
 *  the autocorrelations.
 *
 *  We calculate the pitch by counting the number of samples
 *  between peaks.
 *
 *  Example by Jason Sigal and Golan Levin.
